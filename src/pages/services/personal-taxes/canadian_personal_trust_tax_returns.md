## Canadian Personal and Trust Tax Returns

At KMA Chartered Professional Accountants Ltd., we prepare everything from the simplest to some of the most complex personal returns. Our goal is to ensure that your return is prepared properly and accurately. We take the time to go over your return to try and ensure that you get every deduction or credit to which you are entitled.

Our clients select our firm as they trust that they are getting the best value for their dollar. When you chose to use a Chartered Professional Accountant you realize that tax preparation is more than just banging numbers into a computer. It takes knowledge, experience and professional judgement to help you deal with your more complex reporting matters. It is not always what is presented that is important, it takes these skills to recognize when something is missing.

Many families have trusts for a variety of reasons. We prepare a large number of trust returns each year and can help you with your filing needs.
