## Estate Planning

### What Is Estate Planning?

Estate planning is developing a plan that will deal with your affairs after you are gone. While this may sound simple, it is surprising how often simple planning saves the family a great deal of anger and frustration. Good Estate planning doesn’t come from a generic out of the box solution. It should be developed for each family and takes into consideration that family’s unique situation.

We believe that estate planning is a process that takes time and the input of different experts. For example, a lawyer experienced in dealing with family law and writing wills that provides for effective administration of the estate. While people may joke about insurance salespeople, insurance can play a very effective role in an estate plan.

###  A Bit Of Common Sense Can Go A Long Way

Some matters in estate planning don’t require the advice of an expert. Common sense and a bit of forethought will save a lot of grief. For example, asking family members what special piece of furniture or collectible they would like can save a lot of anger later on. At KMA Chartered Professional Accountants, we suggest that all families sit down and consider matters such as this.
