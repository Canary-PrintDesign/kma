The KMA Chartered Professional Accountants Ltd. team understands what financial statements a business needs vary in scope and cost and are dependent upon the needs of those reading the financial statements. Service levels include:

+ **Audit**: An examination made in accordance with Canadian Audit Standards. The goal of an audit is to be able to express an opinion that the statements present fairly the financial position and results of operations. Audited financial statements are usually required to be presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Audits are the most expensive form of financial statement report as this report requires the most work.
+ **Review**: A review engagement applies analytical procedures to allow us to provide assurance that nothing has come to our attention that indicates that the financial statements are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Reviewed financial statements are usually required to be presented in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Reviewed financial statements are less expensive than an audit, as less direct testing of transaction and balances are performed.
+ **Notice to Reader**: Notice to Readers are generally applied to financial statements where a lower level of assurance is required by the users of the statements. This is the simplest form of report by accountants, and is usually all that is required if the only people reading the financial statements are the owners of the business.
