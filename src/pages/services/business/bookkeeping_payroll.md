## Bookkeeping and Payroll Services

### Bookkeeping Services

Our bookkeeping department provides a wide range of services, from assembling your small businesses results for your tax year end, to regular ongoing record keeping. Our team can provide ongoing advice to your staff on technical matters related to bookkeeping.

### How Much Does It Cost?

Many times, people focus upon the hourly rate, assuming that all bookkeepers are the same. But like so much in business, no two services are the same. What the KMA Chartered Professional Accountants Ltd. team believe is that business owners should look at the overall value of services provided.

Good bookkeeping services should achieve three goals for your business:

- Free up your time to allow you to focus upon your business
- Ensure that your books and records are in good order, in a timely manner
- Keep you out of trouble.

Over the years, KMA has had to help clients sort out their books and records and figure out what taxes are owed. Time and time again, it was apparent that much of this difficulty could have been avoided had the various required filings been dealt with at the time.

While competent bookkeepers appear to cost more in the short run, good bookkeepers save you money through ensuring your records are complete and accurate. Good bookkeepers help you stay on top of the maze of government reports. What appears to be a simple mistake can be a costly error later on.

Our philosophy is that your record keeping should be driven by your needs, not the other way around.

There are a wide range of services offered:

- Ongoing bookkeeping services
- Advice on the design of the general ledger in order to meet your reporting needs.
- Advice on technical matters for your bookkeeping staff
- Regular payroll services (payroll calculations, withholding preparation, Records of Employment and others as needed)
- T4, T4A, T5 or T5018 reporting (contractor payments)
- WorkSafe BC reports (WCB)
- GST/HST reports.
