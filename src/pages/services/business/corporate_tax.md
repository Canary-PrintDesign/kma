### What Else Might Your Company Need to File?

KMA is a full service firm. KMA will help your business register for GST, PST and WCB as needed. We will help you understand what needs to filed and when. If you need assistance with preparing these filings, or would just rather have it done for you, KMA will build a solution that works for you.
 
### Payroll Filings

If your company has employees, it will need to file T4’s each year. KMA follows up with each corporate client to ensure that they are reminded that these tax forms are due at the end of February. KMA prepares and files the T4’s for many of its clients. Our goal is to ensure that our clients have met this annual filing requirement. If your company needs help with the WCB reports, we can help with that as well.

### Gst and Pst

Most businesses in Canada are required to collect and remit GST. KMA works with our clients to ensure that the amount report is correct. KMA offers services from preparing the return for our clients to simply being available to answer questions.

### Dividends and Interest

If your company paid dividends or interest, it may have to file T5 slips. KMA will help you meet your filing requirements.

### Contractor Payments

If you are a business that is involved in construction as your primary source of income, and you make payments to subcontractors, you are required to report these payments to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) each year. KMA works with its contractor clients each year to ensure that this reporting requirement is met.
