## Renewing Your U.S. Tax Number (ITIN)

Starting in October 2016, the IRS has to start expiring ITINâ€™s. If you currently hold a US ITIN, the IRS will now require that you renew the number. The IRS will send out letters starting in October, based upon your ITIN number, to the last address they have on file for you, informing you that you need to renew your number.

The majority of numbers will be required to renew by 2020. In addition, if you do not file a return for three years, then the number will automatically expire. KMA will be able to help you renew your ITIN.
