## Obtaining a u.s. Tax Number (ITIN)

KMA Chartered Professional Accountants Ltd. is one of the few IRS approved Certifying Acceptance Agents in British Columbia. We are able to assist in obtaining a U.S. tax number for non U.S. citizens. These are called Individual Tax Identification Numbers (ITIN).

There are changing requirements and we suggest that you phone to make an appointment or call to discuss what is the process for obtaining an ITIN.
