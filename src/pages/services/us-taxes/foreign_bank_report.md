## Foreign Bank Account Report “FBAR” – FINCEN 114 – Reporting Your Non-US Bank and Investment Accounts

### What Is an Fbar?

An FBAR, refers to an annual report that discloses to the US department of Treasury the highest balance in each bank account that a US person has signing authority on during any point in the year. There is no comparable report in Canada.

### When Is the Fbar Required to Be Filed?

U.S. persons are required to report all Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, including joint accounts, if the aggregate value of all accounts exceeds U.S. $10,000. This only applies to accounts outside of the United States. This is the total for all accounts at any point in the year, not by individual account.

For example:

- Joe has a joint chequing account with his wife and it had $8,000 in June. That was the single largest balance in this account during the calendar year.
- Joe has a savings account and it had $3,000 in December. That was the largest balance in the account during the calendar year.
- Joe has a bank account with a U.S. Bank in Seattle and it had $12,000 U.S. at its peak in the year.
- Joe has an RRSP with $3,000 at the end of the year. Earlier in the year in March, he withdrew $4,000.

So does Joe trigger the reporting requirement?

Yes he does. When you total the single largest balances in the year, ($8,000 + $3,000 + ($3,000 + $4,000) = $18,000) it is greater than $10,000. You will note that we did not include the U.S. Bank account as it is not a Foreign Bank account for U.S. reporting purposes.

### What Accounts Do You Include?

- Bank Accounts, such as GIC’s, money market funds, chequing or savings
- Investment Accounts, both registered and non-registered
- Commodity or investment accounts
- Insurance policies with a cash surrender value
- RRSP and RRIF accounts
- Tax Free Savings Accounts

What to Complete on the Form

- Part I relates to filer information.
- Part II applies to Accounts Owned Separately.
- Part III applies to Accounts Owned Jointly.
- Parts IV and V would not likely apply to your situation, but would require reporting if they did apply.
- The default rule is that each person files a separate report regardless of married or not. If married, spouses may elect to file a joint return so long as all accounts are jointly held.
- Disclosure of this information is mandatory. Failure to file these reports could result in significant financial penalties (e.g. $10,000 or more).

All amounts must be reported in U.S. dollars. You can obtain exchange rates at from the IRS website under the Treasury Department End-of-Year Exchange Rates: https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Treasury-Department-End-of-Year-Exchange-Rates

A note on joint returns: If an account is held jointly between a U.S. citizen and a non-U.S. citizen, the FBAR requires that the 100% balance is reported. Balances are not supposed to be divided in half.

These reports must be filed by April 15th each year. These reports do have the option of filing an extension and are filed separately from your 1040. These reports must be e-filed as the U.S. Department of the Treasury is no longer accepting paper filed reports. There are no extensions for the financial bank reporting.
