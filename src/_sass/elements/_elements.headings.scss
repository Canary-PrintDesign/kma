// Simple default styles for headings 1 through 6. Anything more opinionated
// than simple font-size changes should likely be applied via classes (see:
// http://csswizardry.com/2016/02/managing-typography-on-large-apps/).

// We have all of our heading font sizes defined here. Passing these pixel
// values into our `font-size()` mixin will generate a rem-based
// `font-size` with a pixel fallback, as well as generating a `line-height` that
// will sit on our baseline grid.
